Bonjour L'amour is a dating app whose data is driven by a unique user-driven model that allows people to identify themselves without preset dropdown values for key categories of race, gender, and sexuality.

As the vast majority of people will still identify their gender as male/female and their sexuality as heterosexual (or straight), they will simply sort themselves out from smaller buckets of data automatically where users seek people of different genders or sexualities. Essentially, if a user knows what they're looking for, they will find it.

To accommodate users with different gender identifications, a mandatory question on the form asks the user about the pronouns they use to self-identify. Cisgendered users will potentially find this a confusing question and many will likely not realize its utility, but trans/agender/non-binary users will recognize this as a signal that this site is meant to be inclusive of all genders, up to and including ones that the developer is as of yet unaware.

Likewise, with sexuality, users tend to sort themselves into one of three datasets. In general, such users either seek out like members of their affiliation or are aware of less common identities such as pansexual or asexual. By designing this system to first cater to smaller datasets, the entire site ends up being inclusive.


## The Tech

This is built on a MEAN stack, which of course means MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js. I am also using Bootstrap to further develop the front end.

## User Stories

**Jim** is a straight male. He's heard about Bonjour L'amour but hasn't ever used it before.

He fills out a profile including his username, his gender, his sexual orientation, and then goes on to pick out a few optional items like favorite video games and income.

He's now able to search for all users on the site, but narrows his search to straight women. He is open to both cis and trans women so performs separate searches for both and then emails the women he is interested in going on a date with.

Jim tells his gay friend, **Bryce** that he ought to join too. Bryce completes a profile and is able to find interested members easily and sort through them based on interests, too. For example, Bryce loves the movie Moulin Rouge! and likes to find others who are also interested in the film. He *does* limit himself and his potential dating pool by restricting options like this, but he is comfortable with that.

Bryce's friend **Em** is asexual and is unaccustomed to joining dating sites since she is not interested in a long-term physical relationship, but Bryce convinces her to join since other asexual people are on Bonjour L'amour. She meets a few other asexual people by simply search sorting, which allows her to connect without seeing other people who are interested in physical dating relationships.


## Updates

Future plans on the app include smarter sorting including a separate questionnaire to allow people to skip the search altogether, working out a few bugs with the form, improved image upload options, and a chat room. Also, in the interest of curbing harassment and bullying, implementing strong blocks for users and a reporting feature.
